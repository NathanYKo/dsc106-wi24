Hi! I am Vancheeswaran Vaidyanathan (you can call me Vanchy), currently a master's student specializing in Machine Learning and Data Science in the ECE department at UCSD. Prior to joining UCSD, I worked as a DevOps Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services. I am originally from Chennai, India. I love traveling, trekking, playing cricket and badminton, and watching TV series. I am looking forward to working with everyone this quarter. Wishing everyone good luck with this course and the quarter!
