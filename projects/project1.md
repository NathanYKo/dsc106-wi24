# Project 1: Expository Visualization

An expository article requires the author to investigate an idea, evaluate
evidence, expound on the idea, and set forth an argument concerning that idea
in a clear and concise manner.

In this assignment, you will design an expository visualization to clearly
communicate an idea based on a small data set. In addition, you must provide a
rigorous rationale for your design choices. You should in theory be ready to
explain the contribution of every pixel in the display towards your expository
goals. You are free to use any graphics or charting tool you please - including
drafting by hand.
